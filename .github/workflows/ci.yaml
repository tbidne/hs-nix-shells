  # Originally we had this set to every day, as we wanted to test
  # cabal/liquidhaskell builds frequently for upstream breaks. However, there

  # Arguably we only need to run them on a change, as they __should't__
  # rely on upstream changes, other than the jobs themselves. But it's
  # possible something goes wrong with nix e.g. the cache, so it seems fine
  # to leave them running weekly for now.
